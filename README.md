# Karlsruher Twitter Robot
## Abstract
Karlsruher is a robot on Twitter that retweets followers who mention its name.

*Followers can relay information via the Robot without the need to follow each other directly.*

For example, the origin @Karlsruher Twitter account is used by followers mostly from around the city of Karlsruhe.

*The software works with any Twitter account, so one may spawn simply own ideas...*
## Technology
Hopefully clean-coded, self-explaining and reusable [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) using [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/) as Twitter client and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) as database brain.
### Quality goals
+ Test coverage: 100% ([.coveragerc](.coveragerc))
